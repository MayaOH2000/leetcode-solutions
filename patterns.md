## Arrays
### Two Pointers
- Description: Use two indices to traverse array, often from start/end or slow/fast pointer.
- Example Problems:
  - #26 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
  - #27 Remove Element
- Status: Learning / tentative

### Sliding Window
- Description: Maintain a window of elements to optimize subarray/subsequence problems.
- Example Problems:
  - TBD
- Status: Learning / tentative

### Prefix Sum
- Description: Precompute cumulative sums for range queries.
- Example Problems:
  - TBD
- Status: Learning / tentative

---

## Strings
### Prefix Shrinking / Matching
- Description: Shorten or compare prefix among strings until a match is found.
- Example Problems:
  - #14 Longest Common Prefix
- Status: Learning / tentative

### Two Pointers
- Description: Compare characters from both ends.
- Example Problems:
  - TBD
- Status: Learning / tentative

---

## Hash Maps
- Description: Store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently.
- Example Problems:
  - #1 Two Sum (Revised)
- Status: Learning / tentative

---

## Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Description: Break problems into subproblems and build solutions incrementally.
- Example Problems:
  - TBD
- Status: Learning / tentative

---

## Trees
- Description: DFS / BFS traversals, recursive or iterative approaches.
- Example Problems:
  - TBD
- Status: Learning / tentative
