# LeetCode Patterns

Tracks common problem-solving patterns and example problems.

---

## Arrays
### Two Pointers
- **Description:** Use two indices to traverse an array, often from start/end or with slow/fast pointers. Helps reduce time complexity compared to nested loops.
- **Common Variations / Techniques:**
  - Opposite ends → merge, compare, or partition sorted arrays
  - Slow/fast → detect patterns, remove duplicates, or find cycles
- **Typical Use Cases:** Often used with sorted arrays
- **Example Problems:** 
  - #26 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
  - #27 Remove Element
  - #88 Merge Sorted Array
- **Status:** Learning / tentative
- **Notes / Tips:** Start pointers from the end for in-place merging to avoid overwriting

### Sliding Window
- Description: Maintain a window of elements to optimize subarray/subsequence problems.
- Example Problems:
  - TBD
- Status: Learning / tentative

### Prefix Sum
- Description: Precompute cumulative sums for range queries.
- Example Problems:
  - TBD
- Status: Learning / tentative

---

## Strings
### Prefix Shrinking / Matching
- Description: Shorten or compare prefix among strings until a match is found.
- Example Problems:
  - #14 Longest Common Prefix
- Status: Learning / tentative

### Two Pointers
- Description: Compare characters from both ends.
- Example Problems:
  - TBD
- Status: Learning / tentative

## Hash Maps
- Description: Store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently.
- Example Problems:
  - #1 Two Sum (Revised)
- Status: Learning / tentative

---

## Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Description: A way to solve problems step by step by **reusing answers** from smaller problems. (In other words, break a big problem into smaller ones and build the solution incrementally.)  
- Intuition: Kind of like recursion (it repeats), but instead of doing the same work again and again, you **save the results** and build from them.  
- Example Problems:
  - TBD
- Status: Learning / tentative

## Trees
- Description: DFS / BFS traversals, recursive or iterative approaches.
- Example Problems:
  - TBD
- Status: Learning / tentative
